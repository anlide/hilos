# Testing — Agent Guide

Quick reference for running tests across the repo. All test commands go
through Docker (`docker compose ... run --rm chat-cli-test ...`) and are
wrapped in `composer` scripts — **do not invoke `phpunit` / `vendor/bin/phpunit`
directly from the host**, especially on Windows (vendor binaries and MySQL
live inside the test container).

---

## Environment split — use the test env, not the developer's sandbox

The local environment is the **developer's** running sandbox: the `daemon-start`
/ `daemon-stop` / `daemon-restart` / `daemon-monitor` scripts
(`docker-compose.local.yml`) and the local database are theirs, and local
migrations apply automatically on a local daemon restart. An AI agent works the
**test** environment instead — the `test:*` composer scripts below, against the
test database — and does not touch the local daemon or run local migrations
(`db:migration:up/down` against local is the developer's). This keeps an agent
out of a running local sandbox.

## Framework backend (`framework/`)

Composer scripts live in the repo-root `composer.json`:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `composer run test:framework:install-deps` | Install PHPUnit & framework dev deps inside the test container. |
| `composer run test:framework:up` | Start `mysql-framework-test`. |
| `composer run test:framework:unit` | Run framework unit tests (`framework/tests/Unit`). |
| `composer run test:framework:integration` | Run framework integration tests (`framework/tests/Integration`). Requires DB. |
| `composer run test:framework:phpunit` | Run both PHPUnit suites. |
| `composer run test:framework:all` | `install-deps` → `up` → `phpunit` → `down`. Runs every available test type for the framework. |
| `composer run test:framework:down[-volumes]` | Stop (and optionally wipe volumes). |

---

## demo/chat backend (`demo/chat/`)

Composer scripts live in `demo/chat/composer.json`. Run from `demo/chat/`:

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `composer run test:up` | Start `mysql-test`. |
| `composer run test:db-wait` | Wait until the test DB is reachable. |
| `composer run test:db-reset` | Drop + recreate the test schema (`cli.php db:test:reset`). |
| `composer run test:unit` | Run unit tests (`tests/Unit`). No DB needed. |
| `composer run test:integration` | Run integration tests (`tests/Integration`). Requires DB. |
| `composer run test:phpunit` | Run both PHPUnit suites. |
| `composer run test:all` | `db-reset` → `phpunit` → `down`. Runs every available test type for demo/chat. |
| `composer run test:down[-volumes]` | Stop (and optionally wipe volumes). |

**Typical local loops:**

- Pure unit test iteration: `composer run test:unit` (fast, no DB).
- Integration iteration: `composer run test:up && composer run test:db-reset && composer run test:integration` (first run only; subsequent iterations can skip `db-reset` only if the test mutates neither schema nor data — a data-mutating test needs a reset before each rerun).
- Full pass before a PR: `composer run test:all` (PHPUnit suites).

## Code-style guard and its baseline

`composer run test:framework:unit` also runs the machine-checkable code-style
rules over `framework/backend`, `framework/tests`, `demo/*/backend`, and
`demo/*/tests`. A failure names the file, the line, the rule id, and the document
that owns the rule.

Existing debt lives in `framework/tests/CodeStyle/baseline.txt`, anchored to a
file and a count, and every record names the leaf that will remove it. The
baseline can only shrink: a fresh hit fails, and so does a record that has
nothing left to cover. After paying debt off, regenerate it with
`CODESTYLE_BASELINE_UPDATE=1` — the run rewrites the file and then fails on
purpose so the diff gets reviewed. Full command and the `--user` caveat are in
[code-style/automated-checks.md](code-style/automated-checks.md).

## Selective testing — what to run for which change

Match the test set to what changed; do not run everything for every edit. The
heavy suites (full e2e, two-window) cost a Docker stack per demo and minutes of
wall-clock, so they are a **deliberate, infrequent** run — never an inner loop.

| What changed | Run | How often |
|---|---|---|
| PHP backend logic (framework or a demo) | the affected side's PHPUnit — `test:framework:phpunit`, or a demo's `test:phpunit` | every change |
| A project topology registry — `Hilos::PAGES` / `GROUPS` / `AGENTS` / `TABLES` / `ACTIONS` / `SIGNALS` / `AGENT_SIGNALS` | that demo's `test:unit` — the `*TopologyRegistryTest` snapshot guard stays red until the new page / agent / action / signal is added to it | every registry change |
| FE core / SDK or a view (`@hilos/*`, TS) | `test:framework:frontend` (check + vitest + lint + format) | every change |
| An Angular view's template | `test:framework:frontend:build` — templates type-check only in the ng-packagr AOT build, not plain tsc | every Angular template change |
| Wire / signal / subscription **contract** (backend + FE together) | the above **plus** one affected demo's `test:e2e-full` — the cross-boundary path only e2e exercises | when the contract moves |
| An e2e spec or a selector | that demo's e2e, pointed: `test:e2e-up` once, then `test:e2e -- <grep>` | while editing the spec |
| Cross-connection behavior — subscription, viewport, pending/Apply, presence | the **two-window** e2e across the affected demos (and a full pass) | rarely — see below |
| Accessibility — ARIA roles/names, keyboard, focus, screen-reader semantics | the **a11y** e2e (`a11y.spec.ts`) across the affected demos (and a full pass) | rarely — see below |

**The rare, full run** is `composer run test:frontend:all` (FE install + build +
check / vitest / lint, then every demo's `test:check` and `test:e2e-full`). Run it
when:

- a change touches the subscription / viewport / pending / cross-connection path,
  where a single tab cannot reveal the bug; or
- a change touches accessibility — ARIA, keyboard operability, focus, or
  screen-reader semantics; or
- before collapsing or merging the branch, as the final gate.

Its npm installs and SDK builds are **idempotent and self-skipping**: every
`npm ci` / `npm install` in the test targets goes through
`npm-install-if-stale.mjs` and every SDK build through `prebuild-sdk.mjs`, so a
second run on an unchanged tree performs neither, and says on stdout which it
skipped and why. Nothing is skipped by looking at a diff, and no test or check is
ever skipped — only work whose output is already on disk and provably current
(see [frontend/build-and-docker.md](frontend/build-and-docker.md)). If a run
looks suspiciously cheap, the guards' own log lines are the first place to check.

It is **not** part of the inner loop. The two-window coverage lives in chat's
`moderator.spec.ts` (Vue; settings / bots / profile also carry two-tab tests) and
the `users.spec.ts` of simple-todo (React) and simple-poll (Angular) — one
representative path per view layer. The **a11y** coverage is the same kind of
separate, rarely-run category — an `a11y.spec.ts` per demo asserting the
accessibility tree over the live socket: table accessible names and `aria-sort`,
keyboard sort operability, the skip link and `aria-current`, the document title
and page-change announcement, one top-level heading per page, and presence
exposed as text. Run it in the full pass or pointed (`test:e2e -- a11y.spec`)
while editing a11y; a green inner loop (check + vitest + pointed phpunit) does not
require re-running them. The normative AA requirements those specs guard are in
[frontend/accessibility.md](frontend/accessibility.md).

Always **reset before re-running a data-mutating e2e** (`test:e2e-up` does it); see
the next section.

## Attributing a red snapshot guard

The `*TopologyRegistryTest` snapshots are **shared** across every ticket that
touches a topology registry, so a single red run can carry more than one
ticket's missing entries at once. Before blaming a red snapshot on a foreign or
pre-existing change, read the failure diff **per entry**: check every missing
line against your own change. If any belongs to what you just registered — a
page, an agent, an `ACTIONS` / `SIGNALS` / `AGENT_SIGNALS` line — it is yours to
add, even when the rest of the diff is another ticket's debt. Do not declare
your change clean because the failure is "mostly" someone else's, and do not
route the whole test to a human on that basis. Attribute at the granularity of
the failing line, not the whole test: add your own lines, and reopen the culprit
ticket for the entries that are genuinely foreign.

---

## Re-running tests and state between runs

- A test that **mutates data** is not idempotent across runs on the same database.
  Reset before re-running it (`composer run test:db-reset`, or `test:e2e-up` for
  e2e); the full pass (`test:all` / `test:e2e-full`) resets for you. **Do not treat a
  failure on a repeated run *without* a reset as a bug** — reset is the contract;
  re-running against a dirty database is not a supported scenario.
- To test an **irreversible or time-delayed** operation repeatedly (deleting an
  orphan row, an account deleted N days after the request), do **not** engineer
  idempotency into the test. The designed path is a **test-only CLI command** —
  gated to refuse on production — that sets up or tears down the state, not an
  ad-hoc reset hack inside the test.

---

## Writing new tests

- **PHPUnit unit tests** (`tests/Unit/`): pure, no DB, no Hilos runtime.
  Use PHPUnit's `TestCase` directly. See
  `demo/chat/tests/Unit/MessageActionDTOTest.php` and
  `demo/chat/tests/Unit/ActionFailSignalDataTest.php` for reference.
- **PHPUnit integration tests** (`tests/Integration/`): extend
  `IntegrationTestCase` for a prepared test DB and Hilos bootstrap.
- For signal-layer DTOs that cross the worker → daemon IPC boundary,
  always cover the `fromArray(toArray())` roundtrip — a missing or
  broken `fromArray` silently falls back to generic `SignalData` and
  drops any `WebSocketEnvelopeAware` metadata. See
  `ActionSuccessSignalDataTest::testRoundtripPreservesConcreteTypeAndEnvelopeMarker`.
  A **new field on an existing sync DTO** needs this exactly as much as a new DTO does:
  left out of `toArray()`, it arrives as `null`, whatever guard reads it takes its
  safe-default branch from then on, and every suite stays green while the feature the
  field carries is dead.
- A test that reproduces the defect lands **before** the fix, in its own commit. When the
  fix changes a signature, write that test against the signature as it stands and adapt
  the call in the fix commit — what has to survive is the scenario, not the call. **Never
  keep the old signature, add a parallel parameter, or introduce an overload so the test
  text can stay untouched:** the test exists for the code, not the other way round.
- A green new test is not yet a useful one. Ask whether its assertion could still hold
  with the fix removed; if it could, it pins nothing. While developing, the cheapest way
  to find out is to break one line of the fix and watch the test go red. That is a
  debugging trick, not a gate — the verdict on a change still comes from one full run.
- **Time-based features** (grace periods, token/session expiry, digests,
  scheduled rounds/settlement): there is no global clock to mock — see
  `cli/commands.md` § "Time-based features: no universal clock". Add a small,
  per-feature test-only CLI (`extends TestOnlyCommand`) that ages the one stored
  timestamp so the scheduled logic fires now; never build a shared time-travel knob.
